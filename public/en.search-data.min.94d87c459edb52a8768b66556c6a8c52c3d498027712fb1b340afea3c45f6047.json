Add potatoes and garlic (if using). Reduce heat to medium and simmer until potatoes are tender, about 15-20 minutes. Drain and return potatoes to the pot. While potatoes are cooking, heat milk and butter in a small saucepan over low heat until butter melts. Set aside. Using a potato masher or electric mixer, mash potatoes until smooth and creamy. Slowly add the warm milk mixture while mixing until desired consistency is reached. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve immediately. Tips: # For extra creamy mashed potatoes, use Yukon Gold potatoes instead of baking potatoes. You can add other ingredients to your mashed potatoes, such as sour cream, chives, or shredded cheese. Leftover mashed potatoes can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 days or frozen for longer storage. Notes: # Cooking time may vary depending on the size and type of potatoes used.

This option is specific to one window, so it won’t change the way your other sessions or windows operate. When you’re done, toggle it off again by repeating the command. tip source\nResizing Panes # You can also resize panes if you don’t like the layout defaults. I personally rarely need to do this, though it’s handy to know how. Here is the basic syntax to resize panes:\nPREFIX : resize-pane -D (Resizes the current pane down) PREFIX : resize-pane -U (Resizes the current pane upward) PREFIX : resize-pane -L (Resizes the current pane left) PREFIX : resize-pane -R (Resizes the current pane right) PREFIX : resize-pane -D 20 (Resizes the current pane down by 20 cells) PREFIX : resize-pane -U 20 (Resizes the current pane upward by 20 cells) PREFIX : resize-pane -L 20 (Resizes the current pane left by 20 cells) PREFIX : resize-pane -R 20 (Resizes the current pane right by 20 cells) PREFIX : resize-pane -t 2 -L 20 (Resizes the pane with the id of 2 left by 20 cells) Copy mode: # Pressing PREFIX [ places us in Copy mode. We can then use our movement keys to move our cursor around the screen. By default, the arrow keys work. we set our configuration file to use Vim keys for moving between windows and resizing panes so we wouldn’t have to take our hands off the home row. tmux has a vi mode for working with the buffer as well. To enable it, add this line to .tmux.conf:\nsetw -g mode-keys vi With this option set, we can use h, j, k, and l to move around our buffer.\nTo get out of Copy mode, we just press the ENTER key. Moving around one character at a time isn’t very efficient. Since we enabled vi mode, we can also use some other visible shortcuts to move around the buffer.\nFor example, we can use \u0026ldquo;w\u0026rdquo; to jump to the next word and \u0026ldquo;b\u0026rdquo; to jump back one word. And we can use \u0026ldquo;f\u0026rdquo;, followed by any character, to jump to that character on the same line, and \u0026ldquo;F\u0026rdquo; to jump backwards on the line.\nFunction vi emacs Back to indentation ^ M-m Clear selection Escape C-g Copy selection Enter M-w Cursor down j Down Cursor left h Left Cursor right l Right Cursor to bottom line L Cursor to middle line M M-r Cursor to top line H M-R Cursor up k Up Delete entire line d C-u Delete to end of line D C-k End of line $ C-e Goto line : g Half page down C-d M-Down Half page up C-u M-Up Next page C-f Page down Next word w M-f Paste buffer p C-y Previous page C-b Page up Previous word b M-b Quit mode q Escape Scroll down C-Down or J C-Down Scroll up C-Up or K C-Up Search again n n Search backward ?
