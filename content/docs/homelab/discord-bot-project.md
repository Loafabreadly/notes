## Discord Bot Project with WebUI

**Backend (Discord Bot)**

* **Language:** Java 17
* **Libraries:**
    * Javacord: Discord bot library
    * Jackson: JSON serialization/deserialization
    * Lombok: simplifies boilerplate code

**API Server:**

* **Framework:** Spring Boot (Java)
    * **Reasoning:** Mature and well-established framework for building REST APIs in Java. Offers features like dependency injection, auto-configuration, and built-in web server.

**Frontend (WebUI):**

* **Framework:** Svelte
    * **Reasoning:** Highly dynamic and performant framework with built-in animation capabilities. Supports Material Design icons and theming out of the box. Relatively easy to learn compared to other complex frameworks.

**Communication:**

* RESTful API using Spring Boot for defined endpoints.
* Utilize Jackson for data serialization/deserialization between modules.

**Additional Considerations:**

* **Database:** Consider using a database like PostgreSQL or MySQL to store persistent data (e.g., bot statistics, user preferences).
* **Deployment:** Leverage Kubernetes for containerized deployment and management of all modules.
* **Security:** Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms for both API server and WebUI access.

**Learning Resources:**

* Spring Boot: [https://start.spring.io/](https://start.spring.io/)
* Svelte: [https://svelte.dev/docs](https://svelte.dev/docs)
* Javacord: [https://github.com/Discord4J/Discord4J](https://github.com/Discord4J/Discord4J)
* Jackson: [https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson)
* Lombok: [https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.projectlombok/lombok](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.projectlombok/lombok)

**Getting Started:**

1. **Backend (Discord Bot):**
    * Familiarize yourself with Javacord library for interacting with the Discord API.
    * Define bot functionalities and implement communication with the API server using REST calls.

2. **API Server (Spring Boot):**
    * Set up a Spring Boot project and define REST API endpoints for the WebUI to interact with.
    * Implement logic to handle requests, interact with the bot backend, and potentially store data in a database.

3. **Frontend (WebUI):**
    * Learn the basics of Svelte for building web applications.
    * Utilize Svelte's features for dynamic UI updates and animations.
    * Integrate Material Design icons and explore theming options.

4. **Deployment:**
    * Containerize each module using Docker.
    * Deploy them to a Kubernetes cluster for managing deployments and scaling.
