Marry Me Chicken
================

Ingredients
-----------

-   1 ½ pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
-   2 tablespoons butter
-   3 cloves garlic, minced
-   ½ teaspoon dried oregano
-   ¼ teaspoon ground thyme
-   ½ cup chicken broth, divided
-   ½ pound bacon
-   1 (16 ounce) package angel hair pasta
-   1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
-   ½ cup freshly shaved Parmesan cheese
-   ¼ cup whipping cream
-   ¼ cup chopped sun-dried tomatoes
-   1 pinch red pepper flakes
-   salt to taste

Directions
----------

1.  Gather ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees
    C).
2.  Place chicken breasts on a flat work surface. Slice horizontally
    through the middle, being careful not to cut all the way through to
    the other side. Open the 2 sides and spread them out like an open
    book to butterfly.
3.  Melt butter in a large, oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat. Add
    garlic, oregano, thyme. Sauté until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
4.  Add chicken and cook until golden brown but not fully cooked, 3 to 4
    minutes per side.
5.  Pour 1/4 cup chicken broth into the skillet and bake in the
    preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the centers and
    juices run clear, about 15 minutes.
6.  Meanwhile, place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high
    heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes.
    Drain bacon slices on paper towels and let cool enough to handle,
    about 5 minutes; chop.
7.  At the same time, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a
    boil. Cook angel hair pasta in the boiling water, stirring
    occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes.
    Drain and keep warm.
8.  Remove skillet from the oven and transfer chicken to a plate,
    reserving juices in the skillet. Keep chicken warm and place skillet
    on the stovetop.
9.  Whisk flour into the skillet over medium heat. Add remaining chicken
    broth, Parmesan cheese, and whipping cream. Whisk until combined.\
10. Add sun-dried tomatoes, red pepper flakes, and salt. Add bacon and
    chicken back into the skillet.
11. Serve on top of hot cooked pasta.
