This Marry Me Chicken Soup Is a Bowlful of Pure Love
====================================================

Ingredients
-----------

-   1/2 cup sun-dried tomatoes packed in oil
-   1 tablespoon oil
-   1 1/2 cups yellow onion
-   4 cloves garlic
-   3 tablespoons tomato paste
-   8 cups chicken broth
-   1 cup heavy whipping cream
-   4 teaspoons chopped fresh basil
-   2 teaspoons kosher salt
-   1 1/2 teaspoons Italian seasoning
-   1 teaspoon garlic powder
-   1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper
-   3 cups shell pasta
-   3 cups baby spinach
-   2 cups rotisserie chicken
-   8 ounces cream cheese
-   1 1/2 ounces Parmesan cheese

Directions
----------

1.  Gather all ingredients.
2.  Heat oil from sun-dried tomatoes in a large Dutch oven over medium
    until shimmering. Add onion and garlic; cook, stirring often, until
    softened, 3 to 4 minutes.
3.  Add tomato paste and sun-dried tomatoes; cook, stirring constantly,
    until tomato paste is slightly deeper red in color, about 2

4.  Stir in broth, cream, basil, salt, Italian seasoning, garlic powder,
    and crushed red pepper; bring to a boil over medium, stirring
    occasionally, about 12 minutes.
5.  Add pasta and reduce heat to medium-low; cook, stirring
    occasionally, until pasta is al dente, about 12 minutes.
6.  Reduce heat to low, and add spinach, chicken, cream cheese, and
    Parmesan; cook, stirring often, until cream cheese and Parmesan are
    melted and chicken is heated through, about 5 minutes.
7.  Garnish with additional Parmesan, basil, and red pepper. Serve
    immediately.
