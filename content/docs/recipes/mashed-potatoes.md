# Basic Mashed Potatoes

**From:** [allrecipes.com](https://www.justtherecipe.com/?url=https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/24771/basic-mashed-potatoes/)
**Servings:** 4+
**Prep Time:** 5 minutes
**Cook Time:** 30 minutes
**Total Time:** 35 minutes

## Ingredients

* 2 pounds baking potatoes, peeled and quartered
* 3 cloves garlic, peeled, or to taste (optional)
* 1 cup milk
* 2 tablespoons butter
* Salt and ground black pepper, to taste

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add potatoes and garlic (if using). Reduce heat to medium and simmer until potatoes are tender, about 15-20 minutes. Drain and return potatoes to the pot.
2. While potatoes are cooking, heat milk and butter in a small saucepan over low heat until butter melts. Set aside.
3. Using a potato masher or electric mixer, mash potatoes until smooth and creamy. Slowly add the warm milk mixture while mixing until desired consistency is reached.
4. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve immediately.

## Tips:

* For extra creamy mashed potatoes, use Yukon Gold potatoes instead of baking potatoes.
* You can add other ingredients to your mashed potatoes, such as sour cream, chives, or shredded cheese.
* Leftover mashed potatoes can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 days or frozen for longer storage.

## otes:

* Cooking time may vary depending on the size and type of potatoes used.
* Be careful not to overcook the potatoes, as they will become mushy.
