**Servings:** 4+
**Prep Time:** 5 minutes
**Cook Time:** 5-7 minutes

## Ingredients

* 1 bunch asparagus (3/4 - 1lb), trimmed
* 2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil
* Lawry's parsley garlic salt, to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat air fryer to 390°F (199°C).
2. In a bowl, toss the trimmed asparagus spears with olive oil and parsley garlic salt until evenly coated.
3. Arrange the asparagus spears in a single layer in the air fryer basket. Avoid overcrowding the basket.
4. Air fry for 3 minutes, then flip the asparagus and continue to air fry for an additional 2-4 minutes, or until tender-crisp and lightly browned.
5. Serve immediately!

## Notes

* Cooking time may vary depending on the thickness of the asparagus spears. 
* For thicker spears, start checking for doneness at 4 minutes.
* You can substitute other seasonings for Lawry's parsley garlic salt, such as garlic powder, Italian seasoning, or red pepper flakes.
* For a richer flavor, drizzle the asparagus with a squeeze of lemon juice or balsamic glaze before serving.
